# Assignment 2 - Adding a Database and Dockerize

There are two parts to this assignment:

1. Add a database backend to your server that accesses spacy NER
2. Dockerize the application


## Database backend

You can do this using your previous code for the Flask web server or the example solution that I will have handed out, but if you want you can do this with Streamlit. The instructions below are focused on using a Flask server.

The Flask webserver should have three pages: one that presents a form that you can use to send a request to spaCy, one that shows the result, and one that lists all results so far. The first page is a starter page that could look as follows.

<img src="images/main-page.png" width="600">

The results page includes the results as before

<img src="images/ner-result.png" width="500">

The page with results so far is a simple table with counts for each entity ever found. For example, below is the list after you parsed the same standard example twice.

<img src="images/ner-list.png" width="500">


All the user should have to do to access the website is to point a browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

To access spaCy you can again use the code in `ner.py`. To get the entities out of the markkup string you should use a Python library for XML parsing. One that is relatively easy to use is BeautifulSoup ([https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).


## Dockerizing the application

Dockerize the above application by creating a Dockerfile that can be used to create a Docker image and then run a Docker container that contains the Flask server (or Streamlit application). Once the container is started a user should be able to access it using a URL as above ([http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)) but you can choose to use a different port.

Some of this will already be done in class and all other bits and pieces you need for this you will have after the two lectures on Docker.


## Due date and what to hand in

This is due March 28th.

You should hand in a link to a Git repository, and that should be the same repository that you used for the first assignment. There should be a top-level directory `assignment2` which should have a `README.md` file that explains exactly what to do to run your code. This should include:

- The required Python version. Just list what you ran it on, no need to test on other versions of Python. I hope you are all at least on Python 3.8.
- What modules need to be installed.
- How to start the Flask webserver or the Streamlit application.
- How build the Docker image and how to run the Docker container.

Obviously, there should also be a `Dockerfile` in the `assignment2` directory.


## Grading

Pretty leniently. It should run of course and it should be easy to use. Clear understandable code is a definitely a plus.
